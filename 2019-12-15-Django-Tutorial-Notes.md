Travis CI :
- Automatic run linting and unit test

Postgres :
- Open source production grade db

What is TDD : 
- You start by isolating a particular code to be tested.
- Test are broken down into 3 stages : 
  - Set up : Create sample db object
  - Execution : Call the code being tested.
  - Assertion : Confirm the expected output.

- Why Tests :
  - Make it easier to change code.
  - Testable, better quality code.
  
- Why TDD :
  - Increase test coverage
  - Ensure tests work
  - Encourages quality code.




Happy Learning!
