Contract Reader Tool

In EY Hackathon Ignited_Minds presented a Contract Reader Tool.
This is a tool that analyzes the contract documents and is convenient in
negotiating with contracts. By using this tool, one can see information in an
organized way. Also, it makes easy to find important information by obtaining
those information from the document. Those are:

 Customer’s name

 Supplier’s name

 Contract type

 Start date

 Expiry date

 Attrition rate

 Payment terms

 Contract value

 Limited liability


Using OCR (optical character recognition) images are changed into text. After that
text is analyzed. OCR, is a technology that transforms different types of file, such
as PDF file or image file into modifiable data.
Different algorithms of Natural Language Processing are used in this tool. Natural
Language Processing is a way by which computers can analyze and understand
the meaning of human language. It is the ability of system to grasp human
language as it is spoken. This type of interaction enables automatic text
summarization, topic extraction, named entity recognition, automated questions
answering and many more. To understand human language is to perceive not only
the words, but the concepts and how they’re related to each other to create
meaning. NLP algorithms are based on machine learning algorithms. NLP
combines AI with computational linguistics and computer science to process
human or natural languages speech.

This tool has:

 File upload handler to upload standard contracts

 Categorization and classification

 Automation and Visualization.

Apart from these, contract reader tool helps in figuring out lengthy contract
documents. As going manually through a lengthy document could be a hectic
task.

Technology used:

 For Development- Python, MongoDB

For extracting text- pyPDF2, Textract

 NLP Library- Natural Language ToolKit (NLKT)

> Natural Language Toolkit is a library that provides
modules for processing text, classifying, tokenizing, stemming, tagging,
parsing and more.
